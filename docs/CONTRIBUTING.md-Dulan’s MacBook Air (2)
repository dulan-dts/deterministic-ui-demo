# Contributing

This repository demonstrates deterministic UI architecture.

Contributions must preserve behavioral guarantees.

---

## 1. Contracts First

Every new component must include:

- Explicit state union type
- Documented contract (`/contracts/*.contract.md`)
- Defined transition rules (if applicable)
- Derived invariants
- Deterministic resolver (if lifecycle-based)

UI without contract will not be accepted.

---

## 2. No Implicit Boolean State

Avoid combinatorial flag logic such as:

- `isLoading && hasError`
- `isOpen && isAnimating && !disabled`

Instead:

- Use explicit state unions
- Model lifecycle explicitly
- Eliminate impossible combinations

---

## 3. Guarded Transitions

If a component has lifecycle:

- Allowed transitions must be documented
- Invalid transitions must be ignored or throw in development
- Transition logic must be pure and testable

---

## 4. Tests Are Required

All behavioral contracts must include tests:

- Resolver precedence
- Transition validity
- Derived helpers

UI behavior must be regression-safe.

---

## 5. Deterministic Principle

This repository values:

- Explicitness over convenience
- Determinism over flexibility
- Contracts over assumptions
- Invariants over visual correctness

Rendering is presentation.

Behavior is architecture.

## 6. AI Contributions

If using AI to generate code:

- Include the behavioral contract in the prompt
- Ensure invariants are enforced in code
- Run tests before submitting changes

AI must follow contracts, not redefine them.
